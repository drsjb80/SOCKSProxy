<h2>Java Natural Logging</h2>

Here are a number of different classes to help with Java logging.  I use
logging a lot, and wanted loggers to be easier to create and use, to have
line numbers from the calling methods, to have only the message displayed,
to only log at given levels (not all above some level), and to send logging
messages to syslogd.  Here they all are.
